            <li>Wash, rinse and blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet pepper

                add the onions, ginger and garllic and fry for about 5 minutes.
                Once it is a bit brown, add the tomato paste and fry for 3 minutes.

            <li>Add the blended pepper mixtureand fry with the onions for about 10 minutes.
